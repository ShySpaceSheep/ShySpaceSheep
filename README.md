## External Links
You can also find me outside of GitHub too, such as on <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82251402/152758397-28aa6b6e-08a2-4a95-8d45-16d9526fa5c4.png" width="16" height="16"> **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw34j64pg8LohupWa2aAt_w)** and <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82251402/152759009-7b4707be-3d9d-4aa6-9e85-a7052d07ca9a.png" width="16" height="16"> **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/shyspacesheep)**!

It's still under construction, so please be patient!

# About ShySpaceSheep
Hello world! This is ShySpaceSheep's GitHub page; that's me!
I am currently in university, working towards my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

I've developed a wide variety of intermediate-level skills in high school in fields such as writing, music, and art, up until I decided to make programming and computer science my field of choice when I first had a personal hands-on experience with game modding and other programming hobbies back in 2017 and had a quite nice experience with it. Presently, I mainly study my chosen field, with the aforementioned skills occasionally on the sidelines.

While I lack concrete workplace experience as of now as a student, I've learned a lot of things in project management, general programming skills, and problem solving capabilities in my time at university. I'm quite excited to collaborate with my future colleagues and coworkers when I'm confident enough that I'm ready to take on this career. For now, we're still learning our way along that path.
# Experience - And Future Plans...
I have a [GitHub Pages website](https://shyspacesheep.github.io) for my projects and repositories as well as serving as a more intuitive and compact way of showing my GitHub profile.

As mentioned, I have no workplace experience as of now but that might change in a year or so with my first internship. Since 2017, I have gained experience and worked using these programming languages before whether by game modification use, university work, and or by sheer curiosity:

Currently, I am trying to master either Java or C# as my main OOP language and either Python or JavaScript for lightweight automation and back-end development for the web. I strive to continue learning them every day and to discover and learn more languages as time goes by, improving every step of the way.
